# Roadmap to Software Developer Without a Degree

## Before All

Create a [Github](https://github.com/) account.

## Applying for Jobs

As a general advice, apply for whatever you find interesting: the worst that can happen is the company not considering your resume, which is where you're already at when you don't apply.

1. [Create a job alert on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/linkedin-quick-tips-2022/set-up-job-alerts?autoplay=true).
1. Consider applying for [companies that don't practice "whiteboard" interviews](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards).
1. Consider applying for [companies that are remote-friendly](https://github.com/remoteintech/remote-jobs), especially in countries with weaker currencies related to the US dollar.
1. Join developer communities:
   - [FEDs on Slack](https://fedsonslack.com/).
   - [Front-End Developers](https://frontenddevelopers.org/).

- Learn the shortcuts and try to master every tool that you use, including code editors, IDEs, and the command line itself.
- Get good at typing without looking at the keyboard, and at a good speed.
- Don't go straight into learning frameworks: try to learn and do as much as you can without frameworks so when you actually learn some framework you will be aware of the problems it aims to solve, how good it is at solving those problems compared to what you can do without them, and also their limitations.

## Fundamentals

The more solid your fundamentals are the more things you can do and the more easily you will you learn new things. Get the certificates if you can. You don't need to complete them all to study things from the other sections, but the fundamentals are really the difference between great and mediocre developers.
